        Welcome to The Quilt Community, the official community Discord server for The Quilt Project.


        The Quilt Project is an open-source, community-driven modding toolchain designed primarily for Minecraft.
        By focusing on speed, ease of use and modularity, Quilt aims to provide a sleek and modern modding toolchain
        with an open ecosystem.


        Quilt is a project that was born out of a need for change in the Minecraft modding ecosystem. Our teams contain
        many experienced members of the modding community, providing a level of familiarity that helps us to avoid the
        mistakes of the past â€“ whether those mistakes relate to community management, diversity and inclusivity, project
        governance or transparency. For more information on how we hope to do this,
        [please see our "about" pages](https://quiltmc.org/about/).


        Before you get started, **please make sure to review our [rules](https://quiltmc.org/community) and
        [Code of Conduct](https://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct).** We also recommend taking a look at our
        [guide for newcomers](https://quiltmc.org/about/newcomer-guide/).


        We hope you enjoy your time with us!
